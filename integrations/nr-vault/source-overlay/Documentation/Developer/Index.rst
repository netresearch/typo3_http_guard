Architecture overview
=====================

nr-vault follows clean architecture principles with these main components:

Service layer
   :php:`VaultService` - Main facade for all vault operations.

Crypto layer
   :php:`EncryptionService` - Envelope encryption implementation.
   :php:`MasterKeyProvider` - Master key retrieval abstraction.

Storage layer
   :php:`SecretRepository` - Database persistence.
   :php:`VaultAdapterInterface` - Storage backend abstraction.

Security layer
   :php:`AccessControlService` - Permission checks.
   :php:`AuditLogService` - Operation logging.

Extending nr-vault
==================

.. _developer-custom-adapters:

Custom storage adapters
-----------------------

.. note::
   nr-vault currently includes only the **local database adapter**. External
   vault adapters (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) are
   planned for future releases. The adapter architecture below allows you to
   implement your own custom adapters in the meantime.

Implement :php:`VaultAdapterInterface` to add new storage backends:

.. code-block:: php
   :caption: EXT:my_extension/Classes/Adapter/CustomAdapter.php

   namespace MyVendor\MyExtension\Adapter;

   use Netresearch\NrVault\Adapter\VaultAdapterInterface;
   use Netresearch\NrVault\Domain\Model\Secret;

   final class CustomAdapter implements VaultAdapterInterface
   {
       public function getIdentifier(): string
       {
           return 'custom';
       }

       public function isAvailable(): bool
       {
           // Check if your backend is configured and reachable
       }

       public function store(Secret $secret, bool $persistGroupRelations = true): Secret
       {
           // Store secret in your backend and return the stored instance —
           // on INSERT it must carry the freshly assigned UID (see ADR-025).
           //
           // $persistGroupRelations = false means: leave the record's two
           // group tiers untouched, MM rows and count columns alike. The
           // FormEngine completion path passes false so it does not overwrite
           // ACL relations DataHandler has already written.
       }

       public function retrieve(string $identifier): ?Secret
       {
           // Retrieve secret from your backend
       }

       public function delete(string $identifier): void
       {
           // Delete from your backend
       }

       public function exists(string $identifier): bool
       {
           // Check if secret exists
       }

       public function list(?\Netresearch\NrVault\Domain\Dto\SecretFilters $filters = null): array
       {
           // List secret identifiers
       }

       public function listSecrets(?\Netresearch\NrVault\Domain\Dto\SecretFilters $filters = null): array
       {
           // List whole Secret objects, not just identifiers
       }

       public function getMetadata(string $identifier): ?array
       {
           // Get secret metadata
       }

       public function updateMetadata(string $identifier, array $metadata): void
       {
           // Update metadata
       }

       public function incrementReadCount(int $uid): void
       {
           // Increment read counter atomically
       }
   }

Register in :file:`Services.yaml` by overriding the interface alias. Adapter
selection is **not** pluggable through a tag: nothing consumes a
``nr_vault.adapter`` tag, and :php:`VaultAdapterInterface` is a plain alias to
:php:`LocalEncryptionAdapter`. Repointing that alias is what swaps the
adapter, and it swaps it for the whole installation.

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/Services.yaml

   Netresearch\NrVault\Adapter\VaultAdapterInterface:
     alias: MyVendor\MyExtension\Adapter\CustomAdapter

..  note::

    The three tags nr-vault does consume are ``nr_vault.audit_sink``,
    ``nr_vault.readiness_check`` and ``nr_vault.master_key_provider``; all
    three are collected as tagged iterators.

.. _developer-custom-key-providers:

Custom master key providers
---------------------------

.. note::
   nr-vault includes four built-in master key providers: **typo3** (derives
   from TYPO3's encryption key), **file** (reads from filesystem), **env**
   (reads from environment variable) and **transit** (unwraps the master key
   through HashiCorp Vault's transit engine — see the ``hashicorp.transit*``
   settings). A provider another extension supplies is selected in exactly the
   same way, by putting its identifier in
   :confval:`masterKeyProvider <ext-nrvault-masterKeyProvider>`.

Registering one takes two things: a class implementing
:php:`MasterKeyProviderInterface`, and the ``nr_vault.master_key_provider``
tag on its service.
:php:`MasterKeyProviderRegistry` collects every tagged service and indexes it
under the identifier the provider returns from :php:`getIdentifier()` — that
method, not the service id and not a tag attribute, is what
``masterKeyProvider`` names.

.. code-block:: php
   :caption: EXT:my_extension/Classes/Crypto/KmsKeyProvider.php

   namespace MyVendor\MyExtension\Crypto;

   use Netresearch\NrVault\Crypto\AbstractMasterKeyProvider;

   final class KmsKeyProvider extends AbstractMasterKeyProvider
   {
       // Pick an identifier no other provider uses. 'typo3', 'file', 'env'
       // and 'transit' are taken by the built-in providers, and a collision
       // is refused rather than resolved — see the contract below.
       public function getIdentifier(): string
       {
           return 'acme_kms';
       }

       public function isAvailable(): bool
       {
           // Configuration completeness and local preconditions. No network
           // call: this is consulted on hot paths.
       }

       public function storeMasterKey(#[\SensitiveParameter] string $key): void
       {
           // Write the key to the KMS, or throw
           // MasterKeyException::cannotStore() when the source is read-only.
       }

       public function generateMasterKey(): string
       {
           return random_bytes(32);
       }

       protected function loadRawKey(): string
       {
           // Fetch the 32 raw bytes from the KMS. Called at most once per
           // request; the base class caches and wipes the result (ADR-020).
       }
   }

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/Services.yaml

   MyVendor\MyExtension\Crypto\KmsKeyProvider:
     tags: ['nr_vault.master_key_provider']

.. code-block:: none

   masterKeyProvider = acme_kms

.. _developer-custom-key-providers-contract:

What a custom provider must hold to
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extending :php:`AbstractMasterKeyProvider` is the supported route. What the
base class supplies is the :ref:`ADR-020
<adr-020-master-key-request-lifetime-caching>` request-lifetime contract — the
key is loaded at most once per request, cached in a slot keyed by your class,
and wiped with :php:`sodium_memzero()` — which it implements once as a final
:php:`getMasterKey()` plus the static :php:`clearCachedKey()`. In exchange you
implement :php:`loadRawKey()`, its single abstract method.

The remaining :php:`MasterKeyProviderInterface` methods stay with the provider
either way: :php:`getIdentifier()`, :php:`isAvailable()`,
:php:`storeMasterKey()` and :php:`generateMasterKey()` — the example above
writes all four. Implementing the interface directly is allowed; then the
caching and :php:`clearCachedKey()` are yours to get right as well.

The rest is the contract every provider is held to:

Identifier
   Distinct and non-blank. Two providers claiming one identifier is refused
   with exception code ``1789430001``, a blank identifier with
   ``1789430002``. An identifier decides which key source protects the vault,
   so the registry will not settle a collision by load order — and while one
   exists it refuses *every* lookup, not only the colliding name.

Constructor
   Cheap. It runs while the registry builds its index, on the first vault
   operation of a request. Reaching the key source belongs in
   :php:`isAvailable()` and :php:`loadRawKey()`.

:php:`isAvailable()`
   Configuration completeness and local preconditions, with no network call.
   It is consulted on hot paths, so an outage at your key source must not turn
   into a per-request timeout. The built-in ``transit`` provider is the worked
   example.

:php:`getMasterKey()`
   Exactly 32 bytes. Never log the key and never put it in an exception
   message — that includes the path or URL it came from, which the built-in
   providers route to the PSR-3 log instead.

Rotation
   :php:`storeMasterKey()` is what ``vault:rotate-master-key`` calls. A source
   that cannot be written to should throw
   :php:`MasterKeyException::cannotStore()` with a message saying how to
   rotate out of band, as the ``env`` provider does.

Security profile
   A custom provider is permitted in the hardened profile. That profile
   refuses ``typo3`` by name, because its demand is that the key lives outside
   :file:`config/system/settings.php`, and an external provider is the case it
   asks for. It cannot police what your provider then does — deriving a key
   from the TYPO3 encryption key under another name would pass — so the
   installation is trusting the extension it installed.

Auto-detection never reaches a custom provider. When the configured provider
is unavailable, the standard profile falls back through ``typo3``, ``env`` and
``file`` only: quietly adopting an external key custody nobody configured
would be worse than the misconfiguration it papers over.

.. _developer-events:

Events
======

nr-vault dispatches PSR-14 events for extensibility:

SecretAccessedEvent
   Dispatched when a secret is read.

SecretCreatedEvent
   Dispatched when a new secret is created.

SecretRotatedEvent
   Dispatched when a secret is rotated with a new value.

SecretUpdatedEvent
   Dispatched when a secret value is updated (without rotation).

SecretDeletedEvent
   Dispatched when a secret is deleted.

MasterKeyRotatedEvent
   Dispatched after master key rotation commits, carrying the number of secrets
   and of consumer-owned envelopes re-encrypted. This is a notification, not a
   participation hook: a listener cannot re-wrap anything, because the master
   keys are gone by the time it runs. To have your own envelopes rotated,
   implement :php:`ForeignEnvelopeRotatorInterface`
   (:ref:`ADR-033 <adr-033-foreign-envelope-rotation>`).

AuditIntegrityAlertEvent
   Dispatched when audit verification produces a finding. Carries the alert,
   its stable reason code, and :php:`isTamperEvidence()` so a listener can
   page on tampering without also paging on a failed sink delivery.

BreakGlassActivatedEvent
   Dispatched when a break-glass window opens, carrying the actor uid and
   username, the mandatory justification, and the expiry.

BreakGlassDeactivatedEvent
   Dispatched when a window is closed deliberately. Note that a window which
   merely *expires* dispatches nothing — nothing runs at the moment it lapses.

Example listener:

.. code-block:: php
   :caption: EXT:my_extension/Classes/EventListener/SecretAccessLogger.php

   namespace MyVendor\MyExtension\EventListener;

   use Netresearch\NrVault\Event\SecretAccessedEvent;

   final class SecretAccessLogger
   {
       public function __invoke(SecretAccessedEvent $event): void
       {
           // Custom logging or alerting
           $identifier = $event->getIdentifier();
           $actorUid = $event->getActorUid();
       }
   }

.. _developer-testing:

Testing
=======

.. _developer-testing-setup:

Development setup
-----------------

Use DDEV for local development:

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: Start DDEV environment

   ddev start
   ddev install-v14
   ddev exec vendor/bin/typo3 vault:init

.. _developer-testing-running:

Running tests
-------------

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: Run test suites

   # Unit tests
   Build/Scripts/runTests.sh -s unit

   # Functional tests
   Build/Scripts/runTests.sh -s functional

.. _developer-testing-quality:

Code quality
------------

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: Run code quality tools

   # Code style (PHP-CS-Fixer)
   Build/Scripts/runTests.sh -s cgl

   # Static analysis (PHPStan)
   Build/Scripts/runTests.sh -s phpstan

.. _developer-testing-mutation:

Mutation testing (Infection)
----------------------------

Mutation testing validates the **strength** of the unit suite: Infection
rewrites operators, return values, and array/ternary constructs in the
production code and checks whether the test suite detects each mutation.
A test suite that still passes after a mutation = a missing assertion.

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: Run mutation tests locally

   # Full run (initial tests must be green)
   composer ci:test:php:mutation

   # or via make
   make test-mutation

   # Inspect reports
   $BROWSER .Build/infection/infection.html

The current baseline and top escape concentrations are tracked in
:file:`Documentation/Developer/mutation-baseline.md` (Markdown — developer
artifact, not rendered in public docs).

Interpreting MSI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:MSI (Mutation Score Indicator):
   % of all generated mutants that were detected (killed) by the test suite.
   Raw indicator of assertion density across the whole codebase.

:Covered Code MSI:
   % of mutants **in code reachable by tests** that were killed. Removes
   noise from intentionally untested code (e.g. interfaces, enums).

:Mutation Code Coverage:
   % of source lines that carry at least one mutant with a test. Closely
   tracks line coverage.

CI thresholds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thresholds live in :file:`infection.json5`. They follow a **ratchet** strategy,
so the committed values track the currently measured MSI rather than the
long-term target:

.. code-block:: json5
   :caption: infection.json5

   {
       "minMsi": 77,
       "minCoveredMsi": 77
   }

A run that falls below either threshold fails CI. Ratchet these numbers
upward as test coverage improves; avoid ratcheting them downward (use a
brief TODO with a ticket instead). The measurement the floors were set from,
and the next target, are kept next to the values in :file:`infection.json5`.

Badge generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After a successful Infection run, emit a shields.io-compatible badge:

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: Generate MSI badge JSON

   ./Build/Scripts/check-msi.sh > .Build/infection/badge.json

The output matches the shields.io endpoint schema and can be served from
any HTTPS endpoint (GitHub Pages, CDN, …) and referenced from the README.

.. _developer-testing-evidence:

Release evidence bundle
-----------------------

Tagged releases publish a bundle that records *what was actually verified* at
the tagged commit — test results, coverage, mutation score, dependency audit,
and the reference :bash:`vault:doctor` posture — together with pointers to the
signed release artifacts. It is assembled by
:file:`Build/Scripts/collect-evidence.php` and published by the
:file:`.github/workflows/release-evidence.yml` workflow.

The release is gated on it: :file:`.github/workflows/release.yml` first runs the
fleet ``release-gate.yml``, which waits for the evidence run and for
:file:`ci.yml` to succeed at the tagged commit before anything is built, signed
or published.
A candidate is vetted before tagging with a manual run against its commit,
which publishes nothing:

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: Pre-release check of a commit

   gh workflow run release-evidence.yml -f ref=<commit-sha>

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: Build a bundle locally

   # Produce inputs first (any subset — a missing producer is recorded, not fatal)
   composer ci:test:php:coverage
   composer ci:test:php:mutation

   # The path figure comes from PHPUnit's text report, which the command above
   # writes to stdout; add a target for it to feed the bundle:
   #   --coverage-text=.Build/coverage/coverage-text.txt --only-summary-for-coverage-text

   # Assemble into .Build/evidence/
   composer ci:evidence -- --tag=v1.2.3

In CI the producing jobs run on separate runners, so they upload their reports
into one flat drop-zone that the bundling job passes with ``--parts``:

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: Assemble from a CI drop-zone

   php Build/Scripts/collect-evidence.php --parts=parts --tag=v1.2.3

Recognised names under ``--parts`` are :file:`junit-unit.xml`,
:file:`junit-fuzz.xml`, :file:`junit-functional.xml`, :file:`clover.xml`,
:file:`coverage-text.txt`, :file:`infection.json`, :file:`infection-security.json`,
:file:`infection-summary.log`, :file:`composer-audit.json` and
:file:`doctor.json`. Precedence per input is: an explicit flag, then the
drop-zone, then the in-tree default location, then absent. Run
:bash:`php Build/Scripts/collect-evidence.php --help` for the full flag list.

The bundle contains :file:`evidence-manifest.json` (machine-readable),
:file:`EVIDENCE.md` (the same data rendered for a human reader), and an
:file:`artifacts/` directory holding a verbatim, SHA-256-listed copy of every
input that was found.

Manifest schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: json
   :caption: evidence-manifest.json (schemaVersion 1)

   {
     "schemaVersion": 1,
     "extension": "nr_vault",
     "version": "0.13.0",
     "commit": "9267b6abba37cbe3b7cbdb856b0dc5a00beb2e07",
     "builtAt": "2026-07-31T20:15:00+00:00",
     "checks": [
       {
         "id": "coverage-line",
         "status": "pass",
         "summary": "line 95.65% (11454/11974 statements), branch 87.12% (6579/7551), path 5.02% (2411/47969) — bar 93.00%",
         "source": "clover.xml + coverage-text.txt"
       }
     ],
     "artifacts": [
       {"name": "clover.xml", "path": "artifacts/clover.xml", "sha256": "…"},
       {"name": "nr-vault-0.13.0.zip", "url": "https://github.com/…"}
     ]
   }

The ``checks`` array is emitted in a fixed order with stable ids:
``release-identity``, ``tests``, ``coverage-line``, ``coverage-security-dirs``,
``coverage-branch``, ``mutation-msi``, ``mutation-msi-security``,
``static-analysis``, ``dependency-audit``, ``vault-doctor``.
``coverage-branch`` was added without a schema version change: it is a new
entry in the ``checks`` array, and no existing field changed shape.

:status:
   One of ``pass``, ``warn``, ``fail`` or ``absent``.

:absent:
   The producing step did not run in this build. This is recorded, never
   hidden, and never fails the collector.

:tests:
   Aggregates every suite that left a JUnit log, keeping the per-suite counts in
   the summary. A suite that did not run is not listed — it is never counted as
   passing.

:coverage-line:
   Line coverage against its bar, with branch and path coverage reported
   beside it. Branch and path figures exist only when the run collected them
   (Xdebug ``--path-coverage``); otherwise they read ``n/a``. Path coverage is
   reported but not gated: its denominator grows combinatorially with nested
   conditions, so a bar on it would punish readable branching rather than
   missing tests.

:coverage-branch:
   Branch coverage overall and per security directory, each against its own
   bar. A coverage report without branch data is a ``warn``, never a ``pass``:
   the report exists, but it cannot show the bar was met.

:mutation-msi-security:
   The same mutation analysis narrowed to ``Classes/Crypto``,
   ``Classes/Security``, ``Classes/Audit`` and ``Classes/Http``, held to the
   stricter thresholds in :file:`infection-security.json5`.

:vault-doctor:
   Read from ``highestSeverity`` (``pass``/``warning``/``critical``), falling
   back to ``exitCode`` (``0``/``1``/``2``). Two subtleties matter, because
   ``vault:doctor`` overloads exit code ``2``:

   - A run that could not start emits ``{"error": …, "exitCode": …}`` with **no**
     ``findings`` key — an unusable ``--profile`` value or an internal crash.
     That is recorded as ``fail``: the gate did not run, and an ungated release
     is not a clean one.
   - ``VaultDoctorService`` contains a crashing check by turning it into a
     ``check.crashed`` **critical** finding, so an unreachable database looks
     exactly like bad posture. When every critical is a ``check.crashed``, the
     check is downgraded to ``warn`` and the summary says ``INCOMPLETE``, naming
     the checks from ``details.check``. A real critical alongside a crash still
     fails, so a crash can never mask an actual control failure.

   An override is recorded too: ``--profile=hardened`` on a standard install
   renders as ``profile hardened (configured: standard)``, so the evidence never
   implies the live profile was the one evaluated.

Artifacts carry either a bundle-relative ``path`` plus ``sha256`` (copied into
the bundle) or a ``url`` (produced and signed by the release workflow, living on
the GitHub Release — the manifest references those, it does not reproduce them).

Graceful degradation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The collector exits ``0`` whenever it can describe the release honestly,
including when producers are missing; a check status never changes the exit
code. It exits ``1`` only when an artifact is *present but unparseable*, because
then the bundle would misrepresent a check that really ran.

The schema, the per-producer degradation, and the malformed-artifact contract
are pinned by a fixture-driven self-check that runs as part of
:bash:`composer ci`:
