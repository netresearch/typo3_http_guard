 * Factory for creating HTTP clients that respect TYPO3 settings but prevent secret leakage.

 * This factory reads TYPO3's HTTP configuration ($GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['HTTP'])
 * to respect corporate proxy settings, SSL certificates, timeouts, and host restrictions.
 *
 * Security measures:
 * - debug is always disabled to prevent request/response logging that could expose secrets
 * - http_errors is disabled so VaultHttpClient can handle errors and audit them properly
 *
 * Respected TYPO3 settings:
 * - proxy: Corporate proxy configuration
 * - verify, cert, ssl_key: SSL/TLS certificate settings
 * - connect_timeout, timeout: Connection timeouts
 * - allow_redirects: Redirect behavior
 * - allowed_hosts: Host restrictions (checked manually if needed)
