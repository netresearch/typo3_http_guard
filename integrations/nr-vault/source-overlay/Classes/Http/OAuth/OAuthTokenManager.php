     * Generate a cache key for an OAuth config.
     *
     * Cache key is identity-only — used to look up an in-memory `OAuthToken`.
     * Uses xxh128 (PHP 8.1+ non-cryptographic hash) because it's fast and
     * collision-resistant enough for cache-keying; we avoid md5/sha1 because
     * Sonar flags them across the board, and avoid sha256 because the extra
     * cost is wasted for a non-security use.
     *
     * The key folds in every input that changes WHICH token the endpoint
     * returns:
     *  - `clientSecretSecret` so a credential rotation that swaps the
     *    client_secret vault handle (without changing the client_id) gets a
     *    fresh slot rather than serving the pre-rotation token;
     *  - `refreshTokenSecret` so a config pointing at a different refresh-token
     *    source is a distinct identity;
     *  - `additionalParams` (audience / resource / tenant / …) so two configs
     *    that differ only in audience don't collide — otherwise a token minted
     *    for audience A leaks to a request asking for audience B.
     *
     * The cache holds the access token, NOT the secret VALUES — only the vault
     * identifiers and request params, which are non-sensitive enough to key on.

     * Defensive redaction of common credential patterns from upstream error
     * messages before they reach the logger / audit log / OAuthException.
     *
     * Guzzle's `RequestException::getMessage()` typically includes the RESPONSE
     * body, not the request — so a well-behaved server doesn't leak the
     * `client_secret` we sent. But:
     *
     *  - OAuth servers sometimes echo the offending input back, either in a
     *    JSON error body (`{"error":"...","client_secret":"xyz"}`) or quoted
     *    in prose (`Invalid client_secret 'xyz'`). RFC 6749 doesn't forbid it.
     *  - A future refactor could land HTTP Basic auth (`Authorization: Basic
     *    base64(client_id:client_secret)`) which DOES appear in
     *    `RequestException::getMessage()` when verbose error formatting kicks
     *    in.
     *  - Generic Bearer tokens shouldn't appear here today but the same
     *    pattern would mask them too.
     *
     * Defence in depth: never trust upstream error messages to be free of
     * credentials. Cheap to apply, eliminates an entire class of accidental
     * leaks through logs/audit/exception chains. All patterns are BOUNDED
     * (delimiter-anchored character classes, no `.*?`/nested quantifiers) so
     * they cannot trigger catastrophic regex backtracking.
