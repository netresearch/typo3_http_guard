/**
 * PSR-18 HTTP client that injects vault secrets as authentication.
 *
 * This is an immutable, fluent PSR-18 client. Configure authentication
 * with withAuthentication() or withOAuth(), then send requests with sendRequest().
 *
 * TYPO3 HTTP Settings:
 * This client respects TYPO3's HTTP configuration ($GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['HTTP']):
 * - proxy: Corporate proxy settings from TYPO3 or environment (HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY)
 * - verify, cert, ssl_key: SSL/TLS certificate configuration
 * - timeout, connect_timeout: Connection timeouts
 *   (the total-duration `timeout` can be overridden per instance via withTimeout())
 * - allow_redirects: Redirect behavior
 *
 * Security Hardening:
 * - debug is always disabled to prevent request/response logging that could expose secrets
 * - http_errors is disabled so this client can handle errors and audit them properly
 *
 * Supports various authentication types via SecretPlacement enum:
 * - Bearer: Bearer token in Authorization header
 * - BasicAuth: HTTP Basic Authentication
 * - Header: Custom header with secret value
 * - QueryParam: Query parameter with secret value
 * - BodyField: Secret in request body (JSON or form)
 * - OAuth2: OAuth 2.0 with automatic token refresh
 * - ApiKey: X-API-Key header (shorthand)
 *
 * @example
 *     // Create request using TYPO3's RequestFactory
 *     $requestFactory = GeneralUtility::makeInstance(RequestFactory::class);
 *     $request = $requestFactory->createRequest('GET', 'https://api.example.com/data');
 *
 *     // Bearer token authentication
 *     $client = $vault->http()->withAuthentication('stripe_key', SecretPlacement::Bearer);
 *     $response = $client->sendRequest($request);
 *
 *     // OAuth 2.0
 *     $client = $vault->http()->withOAuth($oauthConfig);
 *     $response = $client->sendRequest($request);
 *
 * @see SecureHttpClientFactory for TYPO3 HTTP configuration handling

     * The transport for `sendCancellable()`: the injected one, or a freshly
     * built one carrying the current timeout override.
     *
     * Built on demand rather than in the constructor so a client that only ever
     * calls `sendRequest()` — which is nearly all of them — does not pay for a
     * second Guzzle client and a curl multi handle it never uses.
     *
     * An inner client passed into the constructor can never serve a cancellable
     * send: an abort needs the `CurlMultiHandler` reference that
     * `createCancellable()` hands out next to its client. That leaves one
     * question — what to do for an instance whose inner client came from a
     * caller — and the answer is to degrade rather than substitute:
     *
     * - A caller-supplied client is the one that sends. It may carry that
     *   caller's middleware, proxy or handler stack, and replacing it with a
     *   factory-built one behind their back would silently drop all of it on
     *   this path only. `supportsCancellation()` reports false for such an
     *   instance and `sendCancellable()` completes it blocking, on their client
     *   (`VaultHttpClientCancellableTest::anInjectedGuzzleClientIsNeverSwappedForACancellableTransport()`).
     * - Only a factory-built inner client gets a cancellable sibling. When this
     *   method builds it, it is built from the same `buildOptions()`, carries
     *   the same `ssrf-dns-pin` middleware and — because the fact is derived
     *   from the constructor having built that client with this instance's
     *   `$timeoutSeconds` — the same deadline
     *   (`…::theTransportTheClientResolvesForItselfCarriesTheRememberedTimeout()`).
     *
     * "The transport is always one the factory built" would be false, and is
     * not claimed: the `@internal` `$cancellableTransport` parameter is public,
     * and a transport handed in that way is returned here as-is, with whatever
     * hardening it was built with. What the seam cannot do is displace a
     * caller-supplied client, because the guard above runs before it is read
     * (`…::anInjectedTransportNeverDisplacesACallerSuppliedClient()`).
